## About 

The project's goal was to create a book of appointment. The back-end should be a REST API done with Ruby on Rails. The front-end should be done with React and Redux. This README will be focused on the front-end. For more details about the API visit the back-end's repository.

The project's assignment can be seen [here][assignment].

The back-end repository can be found [here][back-end].

## The Dragon Flying Academy 

For this project, I created Berk's Academy web app. Berk is the only place in the world where dragons live side-by-side with humans. The dragon riders decided to create a  flying academy to teach the world how to ride a dragon in the sky.

In this web app, you can schedule a class with the instructor of your choice. To schedule a class just follow the steps:

* Signup in the [Signup page][signup]. You will be redirected to the [Login page][login], so login.
![signup-img][signup-img]
![login-img][login-img]
* Choose a dragon trainer on the [Instructors page][instructors].
![instructors-img][instructors-img]
* Click in the button to be redirected to the instructor's schedule page
![instructor-img][instructor-img]
* Choose a spot. You can schedule times with  a green text. Times with a yellow text were already scheduled by you. Red text shows other user's times. Click on Barf and Belch to navigate to the previous week's or next week's schedule.

An important detail: Dohko insists that, although he really trained a dragon, it's not a riding one.
